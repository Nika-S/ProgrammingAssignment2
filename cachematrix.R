## makeCacheMatrix creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse
## cacheSolve computes   the inverse of this matrix (or retrieves, if it had been calculated
## previosly


## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse
## the argument x should be an invertable square matrix 
## initialization example:#  n<-makeCacheMatrix( matrix(c(1, 3, 2, 4),nrow=2,ncol=2))

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
